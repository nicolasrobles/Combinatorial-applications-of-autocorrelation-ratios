# Combinatorial-applications-of-autocorrelation-ratios
Combinatorial applications of autocorrelation ratios (arxiv.org/abs/1802.10521) with K. Pratt, A. Zaharescu and D. Zeindler. IGL code in collaboration with M. Faust.

Adapted code from Robert Dickau (http://mathforum.org/advanced/robertd/bell.html) for the nb files.

In order to produce the diagrams for any choice of k,d one first should open Mathematica_BellPolynomial_Summation_Gen.py.
This outputs mathematica code. Using this code we can obtain the polynomial from mathematica. 
After properly formatting this polynomial (as specified in the prompt of the following) we may use it as input to PolynomialtoCombinations.py.

This provides one with a set of combinations. With these, we can replace the list present in one of the provided nb files. 

Running the code of this modified nb will provide the desired diagrams.
